# DnD-inspired IRL Character Ablity Tracker using AI-based leveling 

This project focuses on tracking your productivity and progress by adding XP points to your "Character Sheet."

Creating this project is purely experimental and have no concrete deadlines. The main purpose of this is for me to hone my skills in Javascript and a bit of light AI model api finagling.

Here are some of the Abilities I've chosed based on DnD:

**Strength: [Your Score]**
Your actual physical lifting capacity. Base this on your compound lift numbers relative to bodyweight standards or personal records.

**Endurance: [Your Score]**
Cardiovascular fitness and stamina. How long can you sustain physical or mental effort before fatigue sets in?

**Constitution: [Your Score]**
Overall health, recovery speed, sleep quality, and resilience to stress. How well your body handles and bounces back from challenges.

**Intelligence: [Your Score]**
Problem-solving ability, learning speed for new concepts (coding, lifting techniques), and technical skill acquisition.

**Discipline: [Your Score]**
Consistency with routines, ability to stick to plans, resist temptations, and maintain good habits even when motivation is low.

**Focus: [Your Score]**
Sustained attention and concentration. Can you maintain proper form during sets, debug complex code, or work deeply without getting distracted?

(Note: Most of these descriptions for the character Abilities are AI-generated).
